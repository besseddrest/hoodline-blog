# Hoodline Blog
This is a project in which I re-create the Hoodline blog using ReactJS.

The boilerplate for this project was written by Wes Bos, and can be found [here](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux).

## Objectives
My goal with this project is to demonstrate the following:
* knowledge of ReactJS and managing the application state with Redux
* knowledge of BEM CSS methodology, Sass, CSS3 and HTML5
* familiarity with ES6 features
* using build tools like webpack, babel, express, node.js
* implement front-end testing
